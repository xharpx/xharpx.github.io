				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Hi! My name is Harpreet Kaur, I'm 17 years old and I attend Cuyahoga Valley Career Center (CVCC), along with my normal high school. At CVCC, 
				I am in Programming & Software Development where I've learned to code throughout my junior and senior years. It has impacted me in many ways but most importantly,
				it has driven my decision to pursue something in the Computer Science field during college.</p>

				<h3>Education</h3>
				<p>As a senior in high school, I have worked hard so that I may further my education in college/university. I plan to major in Computer Science and minor in Finance
					at The Ohio State University. If my plan unfortunatly falls through, I will attend Kent State Univeristy. After I earn my bachelor's degree, my goal is to 
					obtain a steady job in the Computer Science field, and to then go back and earn my master's degree. 
				</p>

				<h3>Career</h3>
				<p>At the moment, I have not entirely decided what occupation I would like in the future, though, I am certain I will pursue something in Computer Science. 
					The time I split between my normal high school to attend CVCC has shown me a future of possibilities if I further my education in this field and continue
					on after college as well.
